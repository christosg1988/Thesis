Design and implementation of DECE/UTH Android application

The rapid growth and the daily use of smartphones nowadays, leads to the need for
more and more application development that primarily focus on providing specialized
services to the user.
The present thesis aims to develop an Android application which will be used by
the undergraduate students of DECE/UTH. The application will offer a wealth of
options to the user, such as department’s announcements, personal grades, presentation
and configuration of the weekly curriculum, etc.
For the application’s needs beyond the implementation, an https Apache server
which uses entirely encrypted communication with the application and a database
built in the server were created.
Finally, the application has been tested on real devices with highly satisfactory results.
